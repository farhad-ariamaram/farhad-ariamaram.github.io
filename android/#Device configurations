# Device configurations

    Device configurations change can Destroy and re-create Activities
    such as screen orientation, language, and multi-window mode

    - Lifecycle on Configuration Change
        when device configuration change, following lifecycle will occur
        onPause -> onStop -> onDestroy -> OnCreate -> onStart -> onResume
        to avoid configuration change should add following code in manifest activity
            android:configChanges="keyboardHidden|orientation|screenSize"

    - Saving Data on configurations change with Bundle
        if configuration change, onSaveInstanceState and onRestoreInstanceState will call
        and we can save and restore data with it
        for using that, first we override both methods and create a key on class level
                private static final String KEY_INDEX = "index"; (activity class level)
        then save value in onSaveInstanceState with following code
            savedInstanceState.putInt(KEY_INDEX, mCurrentIndex);
        and restore in onRestoreInstanceState with following code
            savedInstanceState.getInt(KEY_INDEX, 0); 
        Note: if we prevent configuration change in manifest with android:configChanges
              this methods won't call

    - Different Configurations
        if we want have different layout for different configuration we should use layou directories with
        configuration name like
            layout      -> for default layouts
            layout-land -> for landscape layouts
        if a layout be in two directory (with same name) 
        for portrait use first and for lands use second directory layout
        and if a layout just in first folder for both situation use first layout
        Note: in android directory view mode it will create a directory with layout name 
              and put both layout in that (on without config and second with -land config)
        Note: when use sw for config ,for example if the screen is 1024x800
              then sw is 800 and If the screen is 800x1024, sw is still 800

    - Device Configuration List
        device Configuration list based on Prioritizing:
        1. mobile country code (MCC), optionally followed by mobile network code (MNC) 
        2. language code, optionally followed by region code 
        3. layout direction 
        4. smallest width 
        5. available width 
        6. available height 
        7. screen size 
        8. screen aspect 
        9. round screen (API level 23 and above) 
        10. screen orientation 
        11. UI mode 
        12. night mode 
        13. screen density (dpi) 
        14. touchscreen type 
        15. keyboard availability 
        16. primary text input method

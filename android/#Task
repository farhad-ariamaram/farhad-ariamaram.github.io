# Task
    each application in android run in a separate task
    and every activity that we run from our application run in current application task
    if we want run activity in new task, use following flag
        intent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);

    every application has an process, if we run other application activity from our application
    OS will create an process for that 
    and if that application ran before we start one of its activities from our app 
    the new activity will stick to existing process

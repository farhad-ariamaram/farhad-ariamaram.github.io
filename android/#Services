# Services

    service has lifecycle that are 
        onCreate
        onStartCommand
        onDestroy
    onDestroy call based on service type that specify in return of onStartCommand and is 3 types
        START_NOT_STICKY and START_REDELIVER_INTENT
            stops when the service itself says it is done
            You tell Android that you are done by calling stopSelf() or stopSelf(int)
                stopSelf(), is unconditional. It will always stop your service
                stopSelf(int) will only stop your service if this was the most recent start ID 
            difference between START_NOT_STICKY and START_REDELIVER_INTENT
                if the system needs to shut it down before it is done
                START_NOT_STICKY service will die and disappear into the void. 
                START_REDELIVER_INTENT will attempt to start up the service again later, when resources are less constrained.
        START_STICKY
            stays started until something outside the service tells it to stop by calling Context.stopService(Intent)
        


    Intent Service
        start by intent and does commands in queue
        if commands finish service will destroy 
        declear like below
            public class PollService extends IntentService { 
                private static final String TAG = "PollService";
                public static Intent newIntent(Context context) { 
                    return new Intent(context, PollService.class); 
                }
                public PollService() { 
                    super(TAG); 
                }
                @Override 
                protected void onHandleIntent(Intent intent) { 
                    //do things here
                    Log.i(TAG, "Received an intent: " + intent); 
                } 
            }
        and should declear in manifest
            <application>
                ...
                <service android:name=".PollService" />
            </application>
        and start with following code
            Intent i = PollService.newIntent(getActivity()); 
            getActivity().startService(i);


    Repeat With AlarmManager
        not work

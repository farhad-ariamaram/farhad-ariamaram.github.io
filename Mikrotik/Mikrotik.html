<span class="head"># Mikrotik</span>

    <span class="head2">Connect To Mikrotik</span>
        for connecting to mikrotik we use winbox -> connect to : mikrotik MAC or IP -> ip is 0.0.0.0 default
                                                    login : username -> default admin
                                                    password : password -> default empty 
                                                    Neighbour : we can find connected routers to our network


    <span class="head2">Create New User</span>
        we should change default user after connecting for first time to mikrotik
        System -> Users -> Group: full
                        user : username
                        pass : password
        logout from mikrotik and login with new user and delete default admin user


    <span class="head2">Change Name</span>
        change mikrotik name help us to find special router if many routers available on network
        System -> Identity


    <span class="head2">Assign IP to eths</span>
        IP -> Address -> + -> Address : network ip/mask (like 192.168.1.0/24)
                            Interface : for which eth?
                            Network : fill automatically


    <span class="head2">Routes</span>
        we have 2 route type in mikrotik
            1.Conneected-Route      ->  all switches connected to one router
            2.NotConnected-Route    ->  we have more than one route and they connected to eachother
    
        <span class="head3">1.Conneected-Route</span>
            in this situation when we address eths on IP -> Address routes automatically will be create by mikrotik
            and two eths clients can see eachother even if be on different ip range
        
        <span class="head3">2.NotConnected-Route</span>
            in this situation we have two options (Static and Dynamic Route) to connect networks to eachother

            in Static Route we create routes manually like below senario
                if we have two routers that connect eachother like below
                    <span class="shape">
                                                eth1        eth2      eth2      eth1
                    LAN 1            <------------> Router 1 <---------> Router 2 <---------> LAN 2
                    192.168.200.0/24                10.10.11.1/30        10.10.11.2/30        172.16.30.0/24
                    </span>
                in this situation we assign ip for each router with following in IP -> Address

                        router1                                     router2
                    eth1 : 192.168.200.0/24                     172.16.30.0/24
                    eth2 : 10.10.11.1/30                        10.10.11.2/30

                Now we should define Routes in IP -> Routes (in fact we introduce destination network gateway to the routers)

                        router1                                     router2
                    dstAddr : 172.16.30.0/24                    dstAddr : 192.168.200.0/24
                    gateway : 10.10.11.2                        gateway : 10.10.11.1

                if we had more than 2 routers we should introduce between routers routes too
                in this situation router 3 dont know about route between router 2 and 1 and we should introduce it
                also router1 dont know about R2 and R3 route and we should introduce it 
                    <span class="shape">
                    LAN 1<------------> Router 1 <---------> Router 2 <---------> Router 3 <------------> LAN 2
                    </span>
                    router 1                router 2                    router 3
                    lan 2 : R2              lan 2 : R3                  lan 1 : R2 
                    R2-R3 : R2              lan 1 : R1                  R1-R2 : R2
                        
                   
    <span class="head2">DHCP Server</span>
        for run DHCP Server on router
        IP -> DHCP Server -> Select DHCP Setup -> eth : Select Network eth we want use dhcp on it
                                                DHCP Address Space : fill automatically
                                                Gateway : fill automatically
                                                Give out : Select DHCP IP Range
                                                DNS : if we want assign DNS to clients
                                                Lease Time : lease time
        In this menu we can use Lease tab to see leased ip and clients 
        and we can use make static button to give a client static ip address


    <span class="head2">DHCP Client</span>
        if we have a DHCP Server on Network and we want to mikrotik use it
        IP -> DHCP Client -> + -> Interface : select eth that dhcp on it


    <span class="head2">DHCP Relay</span>
        if we have a DHCP Server on Network and we want mikrotik use it to give ip to other network clients
        IP -> DHCP Relay -> + -> Interface : eth that dhcp Server is on it 
                                DHCP Server : DHCP Server ip address


    <span class="head2">Deliver Internet On Mikrotik Router</span>
        for delivering internet to mikrotik router we have two option 

        first option our modem config as pppoe ->
            use DHCP Client
                    IP -> DHCP Client -> eth that modem on it 
            then declear NAT ->
                    IP -> Firewall -> NAT -> + -> chain : srcnat
                                                action : masquerade
        
        second option our modem config as bridge ->
            declear pppoe on mikrotik to dial ISP 
                Interface -> + -> pppoe client -> internet : eth that modem connect
                                                dial out : ISP user and pass -> check default route
                                                pppoe scan -> for check connnect to ISP


    <span class="head2">PPPoE Server</span>
        for make clients use internet by connection use this
        first Deliver Internet to Mikrotik with one of previous options
        PPP -> PPPoE Server -> + -> interface : eth that our network connected to it
                                    profile : what profile for this PPPoE Server 
                                            we make a profile to use here
                                                    PPP -> Profile -> + -> local : network ip range or dhcp pool
                                                                        remote : ip pool that clients get after connect to PPPoE Server
                                                                                    for Create IP Pool we use IP -> IP Pool
        for declear user pass for connect to PPPoE Server
            PPP -> Secret -> + -> Name : username
                                password : password
                                Service : pppoe
                                profile : created profile
        now we shold create a nat for new addresses to access internet
            IP -> Firewall -> NAT -> + -> chain : srcnat
                                        src addr : ip pool of PPPoE Server
                                        action : masquerade


    <span class="head2">Hotspot</span>
        its like pppoe server but clients no need connect with connection and they login with web browser
        first Deliver Internet to Mikrotik with one of previous options
        IP -> Hotspot -> Select Hotspot Setup -> interface : eth of network
                                                local address on network : fill automatically
                                                    if check masquerade NAT create automatically
                                                address pool : fill automatically -> network address pool
                                                certificate : none 
                                                SMTP : 0.0.0.0
                                                DNS Name : Login page address 
                                                local Hotspot user : user and pass of hotspot admin
        after config hotspot winbox automatically logout and we first must login throgh web
        for create Users    
            IP -> Hotspot -> User Tab 
            in user profile we can set things
            in Active logined user show
        for exception user from login like printers 
            Hotspot -> IP Binding -> + -> MAC or IP 
                                        Server : created hotspot
                                        type : bypass


    <span class="head2">Web Proxy</span>
        for restrict internet use we use it
        first use NAT to give all requests to mikrotik
            Firewall -> NAT -> + -> chain : dstnat
                                    src addr : network address
                                    protocol : tcp 
                                    dst port : 80
                                    Action -> action : redirect , toport : 8080
        now active Web Proxy
            IP -> Web Proxy -> check Enable
                            src address : network address
                            port : 8080
        now declear rules by select Access in this menu and click +
            src addr : empty mean all
            path : *.rar for file type
            dst host : www.google.com 
            action : deny


    <span class="head2">Virtual AP</span>
        cretae virtual APs for distinict main AP from those
        users that connect to Virtual AP is out of mai network by other ip range
            Interface -> + -> Virtual AP -> SSID : name of ssid
                                            Master Interface : when we have multi Wlan specific master here
                                            Security Profile : for SSID passwords and ... 
        Now from IP -> Address make different address or DHCP for this virtual AP 


    <span class="head2">Filtering</span>
        we use filter section to restrict requests
            input mean from out to in
            output mean from in to out
            forward mean from eth to eth in one router
        for block access one eth to another eth 
            IP -> Firewall -> Mangle -> chain : prerouting
                                        src : eth1 address
                                        dst : eth2 address
                                        action : mark-packet
                                        new packet mark : a name
            now in firewall make a rule type of forward that drop this packet-mark


    <span class="head2">Notes</span>
        Source NATs will transfer internal request to out by replacing router ip as source ip
        Destination NATs transfer outgoing request to in by replacing client ip as destination ip

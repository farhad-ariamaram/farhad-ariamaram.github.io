    <span class="head2">Features</span>
        with dialing this codes from extensions we can make it do a job like divert
        PBX -> Feature Code


    <span class="head2">Misc Application</span>
        assign a number for anything (ivr, feature code, ext, ring, queue and ...)


    <span class="head2">Misc Destination</span>
        it is same as Misc Application but we can use it in destination ComboBoxes
        for example Call a mobile phone number in IVR
        PBX -> Misc Destination -> Description : a name
                                   Dial : extension or external phone number (how we descript it in outbound like 909112223366)


    <span class="head2">Announcement</span>
        it can play a recorded voice but dont accept any input
        it suitable for play company address or such things
        we should upload recorded voice before add
        PBX -> Announcement -> allow skip : can skip Announcement by press any key
                               destination : where go after play voice
                            

    <span class="head2">Ring Group</span>
        for distribute call it have ring strategy and list 
        add from PBX -> Ring Group
        skip busy agent will skip busy agent
        send external by put # end of number
    

    <span class="head2">VoiceMail</span>
        create on extensions and we can send recorded calls if noAnswer by it
        in optional destination we make noAnswer to email voice to created voiceMail
        Email -> Remote SMTP for use gmail smtp on issabel


    <span class="head2">Queue</span>
        when extensions are fewer than callers we use queues to handle them
        PBX -> Queue -> Quere Name : Name of queue
                        Queue Password : must be empty because we use static queue
                        CID Name Prefix : add prefix to CID of caller to user know it was in queue
                        Static Agents : list of extensions to answer in queue
                        Agent Announcement : play a voice foe extension user to know where queue from is this call 
                        Join Announcement : play a voice for caller -> just one time play
                        Music on Hold Class : music for waiters on queue
                        Max Wait Time : maximum time caller wait on queue after that transfer to Fail Over Destination
                        Max Callers : maximum queue capacity -> owerflow callers listen a voice and back to previous menu
                        Join Empty : if no user available, callers cannot join queue
                        Leave When Empty : same as above but if any caller be in queue if users go they go too
                        Agent Timeout : user ring timeout
                        Queue Weight : if a user be in multi queue this specify what queue is first
                        Fail Over Destination : where go if timeout in queue
                        Caller Position Announcements -> Frequency : every x time play position on queue
                                                         Announce Position : Announce caller queue position
                                                         Announce Hold Time : calculate wait time and play for caller if < 1min
                                                         Periodic Announcements : play IVR for callers that are in queue
                        Ring Strategy :     ringall -> all ext on the list ring together
                                            ringallv2 -> all ext on the list ring together with a latency
                                            hunt -> every ext on list ring as ring time one after one -> if a ext was busy it ring
                                            memoryhunt -> same as hunt but if from first go to second first ring does not terminate
                                            firstavailable -> first ext that was available
                                            firstonnophone -> first that was not on the phone
                                            ringall-prim -> if first ext of list available other rings else just first ring

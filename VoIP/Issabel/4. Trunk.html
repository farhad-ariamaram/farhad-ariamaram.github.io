                             Display Name (second) : this is important and use in some services
                             Peer Detail ->

                                            same as above but Peer Detail has two additional line

            qualify in above Peer Detail is for check connection between two servers every 60 sec
                with {sip show peers} command in issabel console we can check connection
                after connection we can remove qualify from Peer Detail
    
            context can be from-trunk      -> for connect to TCI services we use this (in this mode we incoming call go to trunk and with Inbound rules we direct it to extensions by CID and DID )
                        or from-internal   -> for connect to another voip we use this (in this mode incoming call direct automatically to issabel and no need Inbound rules)
    
        <span class="head2">Inbound Routes</span>
            if context was from-trunk every incoming call first go here and we direct that with rules

                                                Set Destionation : where call go?

                in setting DID and CID we can use patterns
    
        <span class="head2">Outbound Routes</span>
            every outgoing call first go here. Note that Outbound Routes has Priority
                a user call a number -> number is in inner extensions -> connect call to it
                                     -> number is not in inner extensions -> matched with Outbound Routes rules -> go to Outbound Routes and direct with its rules
                                                                          -> not matched -> terminate call

                                                Trunk Sequence : select destination trunk

            <span class="head3">Dial Pattern</span> 
                in dial pattern we use follow rules ->
                    X : 0 to 9
                    Z : 1 to 9
                    N : 2 to 9
                    . : everything and everycount

            after define trunk, Inbound and Outbound in issabel

        <span class="head2">Connect issabel to Issabel (or other phone center)</span>
            first of all two phone centers must be in one network or connect eachother with VPNs or Tunneling
            create an SIP Trunk in phone center 1 and phone center 2 with following Peer Detail

                    Peer Detail 1:                           Peer Detail 2:
                        host=phone center 2 ip                   host=phone center 1 ip
                        type=peer                                type=peer
                        context=from-internal                    context=from-internal
                        qualify=yes                              qualify=yes
                        insecure=port,invite                     insecure=port,invite 
                        
            now create Outbound Routes in both phone center
            assume that first phone center extensions number are 1XX format and second phone center is 2XX format
            we can use this pattern in Outbound rules
    
            Note : Because context is from-internal we don't need Inbound Routes
